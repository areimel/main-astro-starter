# Interzone Augmented Reality
Pre-packaged Augmented Reality projects for easy deployment.

This project currently uses A-Frame and Mind-AR as its core engines, with AR.js options coming soon for additional functionality. The project also uses Astro as its overarching framework - providing a simple way to manage project and component structure, 

This project is the parent project of [Grovery-AR](https://github.com/thegrovery/grovery-augmented-reality).
